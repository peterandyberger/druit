Pokemon challenge

Missing from the solution:

Search and Checkbox functionality, lack of time

Would have done:

- Component optimalization, removing every logic from the components
- I missed the request for typescript code so I did not do that


React, Next Js
- During your work use the https://pokeapi.co/ REST API.
- List the different types of pokemons on the main screen. ( Use a
dropdown menu or picker )
- When one of the types is selected list all the pokemon names which are
assigned to this type. Include a searchbar on this screen, to able to search
pokemons by name.
Upon selection of a pokemon, navigate to a profile card where you show
some details about the selected pokemon.
The detailed profile card needs to include: a picture of the pokemon, the
name, weight, height, not hidden abilites.
On the same screen implement a 'catch' button, on click, the pokemon
should
be catched. You will need to mark the catched pokemons on the list.
(exmaple: green border, whatever...). When a pokemon is catched, the
button should turn to 'release', if you want to release them back to the wild.
Implement checkbox next to the searchbar to list only your catched
pokemons.
Add some navigation to go back on the webpage, and do not fetch the data
again
Use a loader / spinner while fetching data.
Requirements:
- ReactJS or NextJs with Typescript and Redux or any kind of state
management.
- For every component decide wisely if you need a class based component
with
local states, or a functional component with hooks.
- Usage of ES6
- Easy to read, DRY ( Do Not Repeat Yourself ) and well structured
component

based code.

- You can use any css library of your like, or you can write the whole on
your
own.
- Please use GIT as version control, and share the repository with us.
